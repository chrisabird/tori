Let's face it electricity is expensive, in the UK alone the cost per kWh has doubled over the last year, and reflecting on what we're running in our homes 24/7 like home servers feels like problem worthy of attention.

## Where we begin
As it stood in my home, Frigate (CCTV NVR), Home Assiatant (Home Automation), Plex (Media Server) & NAS were all running from a HP ProLiant DL380p Gen8. At the time I aquired this server it provided a rock solid base to run everything from, and be dammed the power consumption electricy was cheap. Spec'd up with 2x Xeon E5-2670 V2 10 Core CPUs, 32GB DDR3 Memory, 6x 4TB Seagate IronWolf hard drives & Dual 750W Gold PSU, this was and still is a joy to play with. But with a power consumption of 120w it posed a interesting challenge.

>  What's the lowest power consumption we can achieve

Yes, i know 120W isn't a great deal, but over the course of a day that is 2.8kWh, and over a year 1051.2kWh or £273 (@26p kWh), not an insubstainial saving could be had.  

## The challenge
  * Keep power consumption below 10% of the HP DL380p (Roughlty 12w) 
  * Run 6 CCTV cameras through [Frigate](https://frigate.video) with Object Detection
  * Run [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) (and MQTT) for home automation
  * Run [Plex](https://plex.tv) which only has to cope with 1-2 streams for our house hold
  * Provide Network Attached Storage
  * Do all this during the 2022 silicon shortage

## Selecting a CPU
One really handy feature of PassMark's CPU Benchmarks is the [Mega List](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/CPU_mega_page.html) letting you filter on a range of criteria. By filtering TDP by 5w to 10W & sorting by CPU Mark it gave me a hit list of CPUs to hunt for.

In this case most of these CPUs were considered laptop/embedded or low end desktop devices. Which means they were most likely to be soldered directly to a motherboard. Running Frigate object detection on these lower spec'd chips without something like a [Coral AI](https://coral.ai) accelerator was going tax the CPU and push power consumption well above the 12w limit.

At the time of writing, the USB version of the Coral AI was almost impossible to find, but the less popular M.2 A+E Key versions were fairly plentiful. So i needed a board that also happens to have a M.2 A+E slot, which isn't to difficult as this type of slot tends to be used for WiFi cards. The other goods news, these accellerators consume only around 2W.

The hunt began... scolling to the bottom of the cpu benchmark listing gave me some interesting options but many were just not available. ASRock make a great range of ITX boards like the [ASRock J5040-ITX](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/J5040-ITX/index.asp) but they were just impossible to find. So working further down the list and googling for prebuilt machines i found these...

* Lenovo IdeaCentre 310S (Intel Pentium Silver J5005 & 4GB DDR4)
* HP Slim S01 (Intel Pentium Silver J5005 & 4GB DDR4)

The Lenovo was in plentify supply on eBay for less then £150, it had the required M.2 A+E slot as well as one PCIe 16x and one 1X sized expansion slots. With the onboard GPU able to give some support for Frigate and Plex transcoding, the only downside is it lacked enough SATA ports and its built in power supply limited the number of drives it could support to just 2. Though luckily the PCIe slot and some helpful parts from the crypto mining community would solve that for me, but we'll come back to that later.

## First build

![Low power first build](/img/low-power-first-build.jpg)

In this configuration, there is a Crucial 120GB SSD acting as the boot device, the 1TB HDD that came with the Lenovo acting as the storage drive for CCTV footage, the Coral AI accelertor installed (There is also a M.2 NVME disk on a PCIe riser, but that was removed for testing power consumption)

Measuring the power consumption at the wall, with everything running (but plex not actively streaming) I'd failed already at 12.9W of consumption. Though this was easy to explain, that spinning platter of rust of a hard drive is spinning all the time storing streamed CCTV footage from 6 cameras. These drives will consume anywhere from 4-6W to do this, which blew the budget pretty quickly.

## Attempt two

![Low power attempt two](/img/low-power-attempt-two.jpg)

Switching to a SSD for the CCTV storage should reduce the consumption by 2-4w. So on attempt two, and now all neatly mounted in a case (again with NVMe and external fans disconnected) I achieved my goal of 9W consumption at the wall! With 3W left in the budget I had yet to install the 4 HDD's in the machine, power them and somehow connect them with no SATA ports left. 

## What's going on with the NMVe disk

The thought at the time was to sacrifice NAS storage space in favour of lower power consmption. The spare NVME disk here would have added fractions of a Watt in standby, keeping this whole build still well under 10w. In this case though the cost of aquiring a NVMe SSD big enough to replace the 16TB disk array from the HP DL380p was just going to be too expensive.

So back on the hunt... I now needed to power four disks, and I need a PCIe to 4x SATA card which wasn't going to add to much in the way of power consumption.

![Dell H310](/img/dell-h310.jpg)

In my posession I had a Dell PERC H310 patched to work in IT mode, perfect for connectivity but with a nominal power consumption of [6.4W](https://www.servethehome.com/lsi-host-bus-adapter-hba-power-consumption-comparison/) I'd have blown the budget again before even reconnecting the drives. At this point I need to reference [Matt Gadient](https://mattgadient.com/8-port-sata-on-a-pcie-1x-lane-looking-at-the-pce8sat-m01-expansion-card/) who got there well before me on this whole low power subject. Taking notes from his posts, I ordered a 4 port Marvel 9215 based card, hoping for a similar 2W increase in power once installed, taking me to 11w with the added 0.5W per hard disk that takes me to exactly 12W.

Lastly with i needed to work out how to power these four drives. The board is powered by a 65W power supply, if all four drives were spinning up that can consume up to 48W leaving very little headroom so I need a better solution.

## Attempt three

![Low power attempt three](/img/low-power-attempt-three.jpg)

Adding in the 4x 4TB Segate IronWolf drives and another power supply poses as another small problem. We need the second power supply to turn on when the motherboard turns on. This turns out to be a simple fix with a Add2PSU board, these seem to be used quite frequently by crypto miners for using multiple power supplies when running large numbers of graphics cards.   

![Add2Psu](/img/add2psu.jpg)

After some configuration for drive power management, this ended up giving a consumtion of 20W. I tested the SATA controller on it's own without the second power supply finding that only added around 1W. Which means that each drive was consuming around 2.5W when spundown that seemed quite high considering the drives themselves (in theory) should be consuming <1W. Assumiung the worse case of 1W per drive, thats around 6W that can only be coming from the addition of a second power supply.

## Accepting defeat for now

Others that have attempted this build have been able to optimse to near total idle usage, becasue this machine is processing 6 videos streams, doing object detection and persisting streams to disk, it averages around 15% constant CPU utilisation. Along with the overhead of multiple power supplies I ran out of futher avenues to reduce power consumption right now, without spending alot more money. These are not excuses, just acceptance that for now i am defeated, but i might revisit this again.

## What could be done differently

Reusing a motherboard like this was a great way around the availability problem of other options. But the ideal would be finding a board with 6-8 SATA ports, M.2 A+E ports, and most importantly powered via standard ATX removing the overhead of two power supplies. A few do exist, and there are some tempting AliExpress options that could be fun to play with. 

I did also did briefly prototype powering the motherboard by stepping up the 12v rail of an ATX powersupply meaning I could power the motherboard and drives from a single power supply. This worked but would never be something i'd put into production using cheap off the shelf boost converters. A more interesting option could be to replace the 65W external power supply used by the motherboard, with a 120W version, and derive 5 and 12V rails from that independently from the motherboard to power the drives. This could be a fun new avenue to return to and build.
