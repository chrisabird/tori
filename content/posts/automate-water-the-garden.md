In 2020 like many in the UK we moved from the city, setup home in a mad old house. Over the last two years we've spent alot of time turning the blank canvas of a garden in a place to enjoy. Now the challenge was keeping it all watered.

Ideally the gaden needs to be watered when...
  * Morning and evening 
  * Only if there hasn't been adequite rainfall 
  * Only from stored rain water and not from drinking water
  * Enirely without my intervention

What follows in a process of discovery, i have never before setup an irrigation system before.

# Attempt one

I picked up the following
  * 12v water pump - normally used in caravans
  * Irrigation kit - consisting of pipe, connectors, sprinklers
  * Filters
  * Values
